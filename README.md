4. **Easier to Manage**: The structured approach can simplify project management, as progress can be easily tracked through defined phases.

**Disadvantages**:
1. **Inflexibility**: Once a phase is completed, it is challenging to go back and make changes. This can lead to issues if requirements evolve during the project.
2. **Late Testing**: Testing occurs only after implementation, which can result in discovering significant issues late in the process, leading to costly fixes.
3. **Assumes Stability**: Waterfall assumes that requirements are well understood from the beginning, which is often not the case in software development.
4. **Risk of Obsolescence**: By the time the product is delivered, it may no longer meet the current needs of users or the market.

### Agile Methodology

**Overview**:  
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, allow for continuous improvement and adaptation throughout the development process.

**Advantages**:
1. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Agile allows for changes in requirements even late in the development process, making it suitable for projects where user needs may evolve.
2. **Frequent Feedback**: Regular iterations (sprints) and reviews enable teams to gather feedback from stakeholders and users, leading to a product that better meets their needs.
3. **Early and Continuous Testing**: Testing is integrated throughout the development process, allowing for early detection and resolution of issues.
4. **Higher Customer Satisfaction**: By involving customers in the development process and delivering incremental value, Agile often leads to higher satisfaction.

**Disadvantages**:
1. **Less Predictability**: The flexible nature of Agile can make it challenging to predict timelines and budgets, which can be a concern for stakeholders.
2. **Requires Cultural Shift**: Agile requires a cultural change within organizations, emphasizing collaboration and self-organization, which can be difficult to implement.
3. **Documentation May Suffer**: Agile focuses on working software over comprehensive documentation, which can lead to gaps in documentation that may be problematic later.
4. **Scope Creep**: The flexibility to change requirements can lead to scope creep if not managed properly, potentially impacting timelines and budgets.
